<h1 align="center"> Improved Efficient Capsule Network for Kuzushiji-MNIST Benchmark Dataset Classification </h1>

This repository is cloned version of [Efficient-CapsNet](https://github.com/EscVM/Efficient-CapsNet) which contains code that we developed to train model
for categorizing Japaneese characters [Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist). 



#  Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bukson/kmnist-efcaps
   ```
2. Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
# K49 and KMNIST Notebooks

In notebooks directory you can find notebooks that we used to train our models.

[kmnist_train_test.ipynb](notebooks%2Fkmnist_train_test.ipynb) contains code for training and testing model on KMNIST dataset.
